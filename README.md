This is a script to automate downloading/setting up arch linux
One I run to install linux onto the disk and the second one is post install

Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionSid/Arch-Stuff.git
cd Arch-Stuff
bash install.sh
```

Once its done
```
cd Arch-Stuff
bash post-install.sh
```
